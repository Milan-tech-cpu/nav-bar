# nav-bar
A normal navbar is a horizontal bar at the top of a website that provides links to pages like Home, About, Course, and Query. It usually shows the site name on the left and menu items on the right. Dropdowns may be used for better structure. Navbars make navigation easy, clear, and consistent across all pages.
